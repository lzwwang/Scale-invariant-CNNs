# Weekly Report 03

Date 22/11/2019

## Things we did this week

- This week we implemented the paper [Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5104) on a cloud server and wrote the process in pdf file 'SI-ConvNet-Implementation'. 

  - This week we only replicated the result of `10k_split1_train/test` and we will try the remaining 5 splits next week.
  - We also prepare to evaluate the method on Oral Cancer dataset. After we convert the dataset into leveldb format, we met some problem when we tried to opload the dataset to the cloud server. It was too slow at the speed of 50k/s and we need to pay 5kr per hour for the cloud server. We will figure out solutions next week.

- As we got stuck on the first paper for some time, we decided to change our work plan as below:

  **11 Nov - 24 Nov:**

  - Write the summary of [Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5104).
  - Implement the results of [Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5104) on MNIST-Scale dataset.
  - Evaluate the method on Oral Cancer dataset.

  **25 Nov - 08 Dec:**

  - Write the summary of [Scale Steerable Filters for Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03861).
  - Implement the results of [Scale Steerable Filters for Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03861) on MNIST-Scale and FMNIST-Scale.
  - Evaluate the method on Oral Cancer dataset.

  **09 Dec - 22 Dec:**

  - Write the summary of [Deep Scale-spaces: Equivariance Over Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11697).
  - Implement the results of [Deep Scale-spaces: Equivariance Over Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11697) on MNIST-Scale and FMNIST-Scale.
  - Evaluate the method on Oral Cancer dataset.

  **06 Jan - 12 Jan:**

  - Write the report.
  - Make poster.
